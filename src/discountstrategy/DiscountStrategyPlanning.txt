Discount Strategy Planning

This file is for the ever changing plan for the Discount Strategy program.

The Discount Strategy program uses the DIP method to create a receipt based on
information gathered from a fake database class. The purpose is to print a
receipt using a program dependant entirely on abstractions and based on the
project requirements given in class.


Objects:
→ Register
→ Customer
→ Receipt
→ Product
→ Discount


Basic-ish flow of the project

REGISTER
    The register creates a new sale by creating a new receipt with a new receipt 
    number. Data is taken from a customer object through a custmer service and
    added to the receipt to get the customer information.
