Discount Strategy Planning

This file is for the ever changing plan for the Discount Strategy program.

The Discount Strategy program uses the DIP method to create a receipt based on
information gathered from a fake database class. The purpose is to print a
receipt using a program dependant entirely on abstractions and based on the
project requirements given in class.


Objects:
→ Register
→ Customer
→ Receipt
→ Product
→ Discount


Basic-ish flow of the project
This will all change.

REGISTER
    The register creates a new sale by creating a new receipt with a new receipt 
    number. Data is taken from a customer object through a customer service and
    added to the receipt to get the customer information. 
    A product service retrieves information on each product and creates a line item.
    The line item is passed to the receipt.

RECEIPT
    The receipt receives the customer info and the line item information.
    The LineItem objects are added to an array of line item objects

LINEITEM
    The LineItem contains the product objects as well as the identifier for each
    line item. The LineItem objects are stored in an array held by the receipt.

PRODUCT
    The Product object holds the info for each item the customer purchases
    The discount on each product is calculated through a DiscountStrategy

DISCOUNTSTRATEGY
    The discount strategy contains the shared methods for each format of each type
    of discount that gets applied.
